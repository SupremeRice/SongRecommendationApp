    With the collaboration of Chris Silhavy, Kyle Sanders and Aonthonee Emar,
we have constructed a program that will pull requests of a Genre or Artist from
Spotify and display up to 5 different artists or 5 different albums from your input.
To do this, we tee of the SpotifyAPI program and parse the raw data we get from the
feedback of the input. This program is also set up in a way where normally you would
have to request and access token from the spotifyAPI but, we have made an additional
method to generate an existing access token from a previous request.
This program allows access to get know different artists for your favorite genre
that you may of never heard of or maybe an album you used to love that you may have
forgotten about.
